🎟️ Lottery Game — React Practice Project

This project was created as a practice exercise to improve understanding of React component hierarchy, component decomposition, and state management concepts such as lifting state up.

The app simulates a simple lottery system where users can generate random tickets and check if they win based on certain conditions.

Through this project, the focus was on:

🧩 Designing a clear component hierarchy for better scalability

⚛️ Practicing component decomposition to make code modular and reusable

🔄 Implementing state management effectively using React Hooks (useState)

⬆️ Learning how to lift state up and share data between components

🎨 Applying modern UI design principles and CSS animations for interactivity

This project helps build a strong foundation in React development, preparing for larger apps with proper structure and maintainable code.
